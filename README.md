# TTT: Death Faker

Nothing special.  
Just a death faker for the famous gamemode Trouble in Terroristtown.

You can change the death reason by clicking the Reload-Key.
Primary Key and Secondary Key will throw the fake body.

This death faker works even if you are using addons like the Spectator Deathmatch or any other addon that modifies the scoreboard!  
It should work with almost every addon.
